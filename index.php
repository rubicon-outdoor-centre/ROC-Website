                    <p>Rubicon Outdoor Centre is a residential Outdoor Education school operated by the DEECD. Rubicon has two campuses; the original Rubicon Campus is in the picturesque Rubicon Valley approximately 100km north-east of Melbourne. The Nayook Campus, located near Neerim Junction, approximately 100 km east of Melbourne, is a recent addition to the school. The integration of this facility into the Rubicon programs is progressing and presents exciting opportunities for the school.</p>
