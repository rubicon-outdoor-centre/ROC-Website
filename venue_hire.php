                    <p>Only one and a half hours drive from Melbourne, through lush green valleys and forests of soaring Mountain Ash, Murrindindi is not so much a region as a lifestyle.</p>
                    <p>Towns and villages nestle in a landscape of mountains, forests, lakes and sparkling streams; fertile farmlands supply an abundance of natural produce. It's a place to relax and unwind, indulge in treasured pastimes and seek out new adventures.</p>
                    <p>Wander through magnificent forests to picnic beside fern gullies and cascading waterfalls, cast a line in search of fresh trout for dinner, or sample the mouth-watering delights of local berry farms, orchards and vineyards.</p>
                    <p>Water-ski on the waters of Lake Eildon, take to the snow-covered slopes of Lake Mountain in winter or hike to the peaks of the Cathedral Range for breathtaking views over the surrounding countryside. Explore arts and culture at artist studios and craft galleries, and gain a glimpse into the past at fascinating historic attractions.</p>
